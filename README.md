# NodeJS_TP1

## Introduction
A basic app with three routes:
* ``/`` explains how /hello works
* ``/hello``
    - ``/hello`` replies hello
    - ``/hello/[name]`` replies hello [name]
    - ``/hello/maxime`` name replies with a short intro of the author
* any other route replies a 404 code with a not found message


## Run instructions
In your terminal, browse to projet's directory, then run:
```
node index.js
```
This done, open ``localhost:8080`` in your internet browser.
